Location Justifications:



- Stations placed along or just off major Aveneues and streets whenever possible, especially 3rd ave.

- Stations placed adjacent or within view of train stations whenever possible.

- Stations placed along parks and green spaces.

- Stations placed opposite hospital to allow employees ease of transportation.

- Stations not placed along the expressways, since biking on an expressway is an incredibly bad and probably illegal idea.



Uses of Citi Bike:
- Mott Haven has minimal public transport, with only a single train line accessible. Bikes allow for easier movement towards other transport option, hence the extensive placing of bike racks near public transport pick up/dropoff points.

- Citi bike provides for cheap transportation in an area that struggles with poverty.
