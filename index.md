Location Justifications:


- Lower segment of the neighborhood is generally not given citi bike stations since those areas are primarily rail yards.

- Stations placed along or just off major Aveneues and streets whenever possible, especially 3rd ave.

- Stations placed adjacent or within view of train stations whenever possible.

- Stations placed along parks and green spaces.

- Stations placed opposite hospital to allow employees ease of transportation.

- Stations not placed along the expressways, since biking on an expressway is an incredibly bad and probably illegal idea.
